1) Answer:-Java is not pure object oriented language Because java uses primitive data types such as int float char boolean.the developers of java 
made these primitive data types as objects.But the primitive data types such as int float are more faster than objects

2)java doesnt have pointers Because it doesnt need them for general pupose of OOP programming.

4)Basically the infinite loop happens whenthe condition in the while loop always evaluates true. this can happen when the variables within the the loop arent updated correctly
or aren't updated at all.

5)YES. we can overload the main method in java.

6)Java main method is always static,so that compiler can call it without the creation of an object of the class.

7)A static variable is instantiated once, a static method can be called from a class without instantiating an instance othe class,
a static class csnnot be instantiated.

9)Heap,stack,code and static

10) Instance Variable:- 
      1.a variable that is bounded to the object itself
      2.it is possible to use access modifiers for the instance variables
      3.can have default values
      4.instance variables are created at the creation of object.
      
    Local Variable:-
      1. A variable that is typically used in a method or a constructor
      2.it is not possible to use access modifiers for the local bariables
      3.do not have default values
      4.Local variables create when entering the method or a constructor.

11) Boostrap class loader searches for main function in the class file, if main function is not declared as static, it will through
an error Because declaring function as static allows it to be called without instantiating that class file where the main function is.

12)The JDk is a platform to building Java applications.
   JVM and JRE are the variants.

13)JDK is mainly used for code execution and development of the application.
   
   JRE is mainly responsible for creating environment for code execution.

   JVM on other hand specifies all the implementation and responsible to provide these implementations to JRE

14)NO , we cannot use

16)Polymorphism is a many forms and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.

17)Data Abstraction is the process that certain details are hidden and some essential information are shown to the users.

18)Encapsulation is the process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit.

19) Abstract Class
     1.this can have abstract and non abstract methods
     2.doesnt support multiple inheritance.
     3.can have final,non final, static and nonstatic.
     4.can provide implementation of interface.
     5.Abstract keyword is used to declare abstract class.
  
   Interface
     1.can have only Abstract methods.
     2.supports Multiple inheritance.
     3.has only static and final varaibles.
     4.cant provide the implementation of abstract class.
     5.interface keyword is used to declare the interface.

20)if a class has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters.

21)if subclass has the same method that declared in parent class.

22)NO.

27)Constructor is a block of codes that similar to the method
   YES we can overload .

28)there are two types of constructor
    1.default constructor
    2.parameterised constructor

29)There are 5 types of inheritance
   1.single
   2.Multilevel
   3.Hierarchical
   4.Multiple
   5.Hybrid.
